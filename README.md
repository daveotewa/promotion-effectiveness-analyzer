## üéØ Goals

The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the impact of promotional strategies on product sales and business performance. Through comprehensive data analysis, the tool aims to quantify how promotions influence sales volume, revenue, and customer behavior. Specifically, the analysis focuses on identifying which products benefit the most from promotions, comparing promotional periods to non-promotional baselines, and calculating the return on investment (ROI) for each campaign. It also explores patterns in customer response, optimal discount ranges, and seasonal or time-based trends. By generating visual insights and performance metrics, this tool empowers businesses to make informed decisions about future promotional strategies, discount planning, and marketing investments. Ultimately, the analyzer serves as a decision-support system for improving the effectiveness and profitability of e-commerce campaigns.
